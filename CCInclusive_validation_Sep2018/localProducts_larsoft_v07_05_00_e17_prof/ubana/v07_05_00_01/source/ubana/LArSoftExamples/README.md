# LArSoft Examples

These modules are intended to be used as reference example for MicroBooNE 
analyzers which are new to writing and using LArSoft modules. 

These examples come with a few qualifiers:
* I am not a cpp guru
* These examples are not sanctioned by the LArSoft team

These modules have been tested against the current state-of-the-art
uboonecode release, v07_04_00, and they seem to work.

There is an example MCC8 artroot file which you can run these modules over
to test out the output in this directory:
/uboone/data/users/alister1/ub_larexamples_static/

Feel free to add additional examples to this directory!
