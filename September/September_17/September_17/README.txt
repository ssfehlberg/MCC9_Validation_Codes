Here is the dumping ground for all things related to the CCNP validation of MCC9. There are a total of 6 files (each with corresponding .C and .h files) which represent the MC, bnb, and extbnb in both 1d and 2d convolutions. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 9/18/18 10:46 am: None of the files have been run over to make the histograms as they still need to be edited for the over various kinematic variables that are in the CC tech note. 

However, they do all include the Vertex x,y,z, track phi, PFP multi,track multi, track mom, track costheta,track length (Figure 5.16) variables that are ready to be filled.
